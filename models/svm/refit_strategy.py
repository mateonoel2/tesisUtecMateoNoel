    """Define the strategy to select the best estimator.

    The strategy defined here is to filter-out all results below a precision threshold
    of 0.98, rank the remaining by recall and keep all models with one standard
    deviation of the best by recall. Once these models are selected, we can select the
    fastest model to predict.

    ----------

    best_index : int
